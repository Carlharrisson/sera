# 🧾 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Owner**: Carl (solo builder)  

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create a clean, high-impact landing page that positions **Sera** as the no-fluff automation solution for small agency founders. This landing page is designed to:

- Instantly communicate **what Sera is**, **who it’s for**, and **why it matters**
- Show that Sera delivers **outcome-first automation**, not vague AI tooling
- Convert qualified attention into **leads, audits, or intro conversations**
- Make it easy to explain and share the offer across Twitter, email, and Slack

---

## 💡 Core Purpose

This is not a visual playground or case study archive.

This is a single-page asset that:
- Frames Sera as a **solution to 3 core agency ops problems** (Slack delays, task gaps, missed follow-ups)
- Highlights the **value, urgency, and speed** of fixing those
- Builds trust with sharp messaging, visual clarity, and Loom-backed proof
- Drives interest without friction (no form walls, no long scrolls)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 (App Router)  
- **Language**: TypeScript  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS  
- **Bundler**: Turbopack  
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (for enter animations only, optional)  
- **Deployment**: Vercel (target)  
- **Font**: System default unless otherwise defined (no remote Google Fonts)

## 📐 Technical Specs & Constraints

- ⚡ Must load in <1s on 4G mobile  
- 📱 Mobile-first, with 120px vertical spacing between sections  
- 🧩 Component-based: reuse UI primitives across layout  
- 💬 Text content must be imported from a central `content.ts` file  
- 🧪 Built for rapid iteration with Cursor: small commits, scoped features  
- 💡 Animations must not block interactivity or delay content paint  
- ❌ No client-side data fetching, CMS, or backend logic in initial version  
- 🧼 Fully SSR/static by default
