# ðŸ§¾ RFC: Hero Section

**Feature Name**: `HeroSection`  
**Component Path**: `components/sections/hero-section.tsx`  
**Target Page**: `app/page.tsx`  
**Owner**: Carl

---

## ðŸ§© Purpose

The Hero Section is the first element users see. It must **immediately explain what Sera is, who itâ€™s for, and why it matters** â€” in under 5 seconds.

It should:
- Grab attention with a sharp, pain-based headline
- Render instantly on mobile and desktop

ðŸ›  Tech/Style Constraints
Built with Next.js 15 (App Router)

Must use Tailwind CSS for styling

Use system fonts â€” no external font loads

Responsive from 320px â†’ 1440px

Text should scale well on mobile

CTA should use a Button component from components/ui/button.tsx

ðŸ§¼ Accessibility
Ensure h1 is used for the headline

Button must be keyboard-focusable and accessible

Use semantic HTML only (no <div className="button">)

ðŸ§ª Test Plan
Load page in Chrome and Safari mobile simulator

Ensure:

Text is legible and unclipped on all viewports

CTA is tappable and scrolls to #how-it-works

Load time <1s on Lighthouse

Component compiles with no Tailwind warnings

ðŸ“¦ Dependencies
Button component (components/ui/button.tsx)

content/hero.ts

âœ… Completion Criteria
Component is implemented and imported in app/page.tsx

Copy pulls from content/hero.ts

Scroll CTA works on all major browsers

Visual QA passed on iOS + Android viewports

You (Carl) are satisfied with the first-fold impression and clarity
